# --YOU MAY EDIT THIS WHILE THE SERVER IS ON, DO NOT WORRY!...THE CONFIG REFRESHES TO SEE THE CHANGES YOU MADE AUTOMATICALLY--

# This changes the jar file name. PLEASE MAKE SURE IT MATCHES THE JAR FILE NAME OR ELSE IT WILL CREATE A NEW JAR FILE.
# Also make sure to include ".jar".
jar-name: "server.jar"

# This how you can customize the type of server you would like. It is defaulted to "AUTO".
# AUTO allows the server to read the JAR file and determine for itself the type of server. However, you can override this.
# The current options for selecting the server jar are "purpur" or "paper".
server-type: "AUTO"

# Config Version. Like every spigot dev, we ask that you DO NOT CHANGE THIS PLEASE.
config-version: 9
